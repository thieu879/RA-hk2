            const sentence = "If humans could fly, there would be significant impacts on many fields, including transportation, architecture, and entertainment. In terms of transportation, human flight will revolutionize the way we travel, making it possible for us to reach our destinations more quickly and efficiently than ever before. This can significantly reduce travel time and costs as well as reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. In addition, new forms of entertainment such as aerial amusement parks and aerial tours will be developed, bringing unique and exciting experiences to people of all ages. In short, if humans could colonize a new planet or fly, there would be countless advantages and disadvantages as well as a significant impact on many fields.";
