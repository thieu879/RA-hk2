            const sentence = "The prospect of mankind moving to another planet in the future is a topic of intense debate and, interestingly, it is becoming increasingly plausible due to rapid advancements in space exploration technology. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be overcome, notably the harsh conditions on other planets and the vast distances involved. Despite these obstacles, the potential benefits of such a move, including the survival of the human species and the opportunity for scientific discovery, are compelling. Therefore, while it may not happen in the immediate future, it is conceivable that mankind could one day call another planet home. This would undoubtedly represent a monumental achievement in human history and potentially usher in a new era of interplanetary civilization.";
